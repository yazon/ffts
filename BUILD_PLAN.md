# FFTS Build System Modernization Plan (2024/2025)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy to modernize the FFTS (Fastest Fourier Transform in the South) build architecture from its current dual autotools/CMake approach to a unified, modern build system that meets 2024/2025 industry standards.

**Current State**: Legacy dual-build system with autotools (primary) and CMake (secondary), fragmented cross-compilation scripts, outdated toolchain requirements, and limited CI/CD integration.

**Target State**: Unified modern build system with CMake 3.25+, comprehensive cross-platform support, containerized builds, and developer-friendly tooling.

## 1. Current Architecture Assessment

### 1.1 Build System Analysis

#### Primary Build System: Autotools
- **configure.ac**: Outdated (requires autoconf 2.65, current is 2.72+)
- **Makefile.am**: Basic structure with limited optimization
- **Dependencies**: Manual dependency management, no package manager integration
- **Cross-compilation**: Platform-specific scripts with hardcoded paths

#### Secondary Build System: CMake
- **Version**: Requires CMake 2.8.12 (extremely outdated, current is 3.25+)
- **Features**: Limited modern CMake practices, no FetchContent, no proper target-based approach
- **Integration**: Minimal CI/CD support, basic Travis configuration

### 1.2 Current Pain Points

#### Build System Fragmentation
- Two separate build systems with different feature sets
- Inconsistent cross-compilation support between autotools and CMake
- Manual script management for different platforms (build_arm64.sh, build_android.sh, build_iphone.sh)

#### Outdated Toolchain Requirements
- CMake 2.8.12 requirement (released 2012)
- Autoconf 2.65 requirement (released 2010)
- No support for modern C++ standards or compiler features

#### Cross-Platform Limitations
- Platform-specific build scripts with hardcoded toolchain paths
- Limited containerization support
- No reproducible build guarantees
- Manual dependency resolution

#### Developer Experience Issues
- No unified build interface
- Complex cross-compilation setup
- Limited error handling and diagnostics
- No interactive configuration options

### 1.3 Current Architecture Strengths

#### Multi-Architecture Support
- Comprehensive ARM/ARM64 support with NEON optimizations
- SSE/SSE2/SSE3 support for x86/x64
- VFP support for ARM
- Dynamic code generation capabilities

#### Modular Source Organization
- Well-structured source tree with architecture-specific directories
- Clear separation of concerns in source files
- Good header organization
